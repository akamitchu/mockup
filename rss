Depending on the size and complexity of the dataset, the process can take many months to complete.</p><p>The Einstein Analytics Platform reverses this process. It treats data ingestion not as an exercise in “extract, transform, and load” (or ETL, the traditional way of ingesting data into a database), but as ELT — data is extracted, loaded, indexed, and made available immediately for analysis or additional transformations.</p><p>Einstein Analytics accommodates heterogeneous data of any form, type, or source. The platform enables immediate search and exploration of the raw data, allowing the analytics tool to detect patterns and relationships instead of requiring a lengthy data normalization process. Data is loaded into a proprietary, non-relational store, with a dynamic, horizontally scalable key-value pair approach. The workflow engine applies small, inline transformations upon ingestion — pruning, filtering, partitioning, and augmenting — but largely stores the data in its native form. The benefit is that you gain rapid access to your data, and can immediately determine in what ways the data is relevant to your needs — without weeks or months of investment in “cleaning up” data before exploring it. Once you determine the applications of the data, you can specify more transformations to make it easier and richer for end-users to consume.</p><p>This makes self-service data exploration rapid and iterative, putting the ability to understand relationships between data in the hands of the end users and allowing enterprises to dramatically shorten the path to innovation. Users can access a rich dataset with meaningful attributes and context, which might have otherwise been limited in the process of normalizing and fitting data into a pre-ordained structure. Then, users can easily connect that data with other types and forms of data — combining information from their CRM with data from their ERP platform, or joining values from spreadsheets with machine-generated location data — for new opportunities for revenue, investigation and exploration.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Search-based exploration]]></title><description><![CDATA[Process queries of large, heterogeneous datasets in seconds.]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/the-editor/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Ghost__Post__5e9dd008d6b2840cc0b0269b</guid><category><![CDATA[Speed]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Prabhat Mishra]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 16:38:37 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/writing-posts-with-ghost.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="process-queries-of-large-heterogeneous-datasets-in-seconds-">Process queries of large, heterogeneous datasets in seconds.</h3><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/writing-posts-with-ghost.png" alt="Search-based exploration"/><p>Einstein Analytics uses a search-based query engine that is similar in its design to modern, commercial search engines such as Google and Bing. Data is ingested and stored as key-value pairs in a non-relational inverted index, permitting variable numbers of dimensions and attributes for data and the accommodation of text strings and unstructured data, as well as data sets with variable levels of completeness or characterization. Unlike traditional relational databases, key-value pairs only store non-empty data values, which, in the case of really sparse data, adds to data storage efficiency and speed. Einstein Analytics’s query engine is highly optimized, using proprietary techniques such as differential encoding, vector encoding, and incremental encoding to compress data andmake queries on compressed data as fast and efficiently as possible.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Columnar, in-memory aggregation and calculation]]></title><description><![CDATA[Gain incredible speed by dramatically             optimizing the query.

Performance of a query depends on a combination of data structure and query strategy, and Einstein Analytics brings both together. With relational databases, a query on a large dataset requires the analytics engine to process each value in each row of a very large set of data. Business analytics users often share the experience of starting a query and going to fetch a cup of coffee while waiting for the process to finish, which can sometimes take 30 minutes to an hour or more. With the inverted index, Einstein Analytics permits datasets equivalent to up to a billion rows to be queried in seconds.</p><p>In addition to the inverted index, Einstein Analytics combines other strategies to achieve unparalleled speed. For one thing, it heavily compresses 9data. Using a variety of proprietary compression techniques, the workflow engine that ingests and transforms data is able to store it at a significantly smaller size than the original source data — at compression ratios that can exceed 90%. Einstein Analytics’s specialized compression and the algorithms that operate on a compressed data platform perform significantly better on modern CPUs, resulting in more efficient computation.</p><p>Additionally, the Einstein Analytics query engine relies on the massively parallel processing architecture of Salesforce’s cloud – with more than 40,000 available processors in the cloud, further powering computations at near-instantaneous speed. However, because of the heavy compression, Einstein Analytics uses as few resources as possible to reach answers to queries.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Security]]></title><description><![CDATA[Trust is inherent with Salesforce’s secure cloud.]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/admin-settings/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Ghost__Post__5e9dd008d6b2840cc0b02697</guid><category><![CDATA[Security]]></category><category><![CDATA[Trust]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Prabhat Mishra]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 16:38:35 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/admin-settings.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="trust-is-inherent-with-salesforce-s-secure-cloud-">Trust is inherent with Salesforce’s secure cloud.</h3><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/admin-settings.png" alt="Security"/><p>With more than 100,000 customers now using Salesforce products, the company has made trust, the privacy and security of customer data, its top priority.
